- _TITLE:_   Web based git workflow - overview of various scm systems

- _SUMMARY:_ The talk summarized a few key features that web based scm tools usually provide. It also gives an overview of a few popular tools out there (including GitHub). And yes, we expect to have a quick live demo.

- _SPEAKER BIO:_ Kuba’s first Linux kernel was 2.0.36 on red hat 5 (before RHEL versioning scheme). He has operated an internet provider throughout 2000’s, serving over 150 nodes. Spent a few years at Orange in Europe working on enterprise integration (including cvs-nt and svm). In 2006, he moved to Japan to work as a VP at Morgan Stanley (believe it or not, there was some RCS in use in 2007-9, later replaces with perforce). Fast forward to 2016, a DevOps director at a machine learning startup called ZestFinance (and zest is hiring more devops).
