- _TITLE:_ From 1 Million service hooks to 1 GitHub App


- _SUMMARY:_ 

GitHub Service Hooks have been a foundational stone of many third-party add-ons in the GitHub Ecosystem.

Every event you can imagine is covered, with the majority of these being Repository based. From a new push, a new tag, a deleted branch, or the visibility of a Repository, over 35 different events exist!

But in the Service Hook world, every repository hook can be different from the last, even when attached to the same third-party addon. Mix in some authentication using OAuth, and the complexity gets more interesting, and confusing.

This is why we now have GitHub Apps; better consistency, a better security model, and a better user and trust experience.

We’ll dive into the full GitHub Apps world, from authentication, to authorization, to events, and permissions. And most importantly, talk about how Travis CI moved from over one million service hooks to one GitHub App.

- _SPEAKER:_ Georgia Rust, Solutions Engineer, GitHub

- _TITLE:_ What's new in GitHub?

- _SPEAKER BIO:_

I’m Georgia, a Solutions Engineer at GitHub. I am a vivacious learner obsessed with effective communication and clean design. I get up and go to work excited to guide GitHub's customers through architecture and implementation processes and ensure that GitHub is implemented and customized to fit each customer's needs and requirements.

I first learned about GitHub and the open-source community while attending Dev Bootcamp, a 19-week intensive training program for web developers. Since then, I have become very passionate about mentoring “non-tech savvy” girls in STEM so they can feel empowered to become our future technology leaders. I try my best to support technology nonprofits such as Girls Who Code and Thorn. These initiatives and other open-source projects are what make me believe in the power of sharing ideas and code on GitHub and excited to come to work!

In my spare time, you can find me practicing throwing on a ceramics wheel, making sushi at home, or you can’t find me because I am off traveling somewhere new!
