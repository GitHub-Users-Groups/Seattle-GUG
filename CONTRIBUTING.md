# Contributing

Well, thank you if you are interested in contributing!

You can help us with the [open issues](https://github.com/GitHub-Users-Groups/Seattle-GUG/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue), or directly submit improvements or new things.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to Seattle-GUG](https://github.com/GitHub-Users-Groups/Seattle-GUG/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)).

### How to commit

Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature/topic per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits (use of emoji is cool!). One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Make sure to: 
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Thanks!
